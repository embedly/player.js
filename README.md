Player.js
=========

A JavaScript library for interacting with iframes that support Player.js
spec.

```js
const player = new playerjs.Player('iframe');

player.on('ready', () => {
  player.on('play', () => {
    console.log('play');
  });

  player.getDuration(duration => console.log(duration));

  if (player.supports('method', 'mute')) {
    player.mute();
  }

  player.play();
});
```

Install
-------

Player.js is hosted on Embedly's CDN. :

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.embed.ly/player-0.1.0.min.js"></script>
```

install via npm :

```sh
npm install player.js
```

Ready
-----

Because of the dance that we need to do between both iframes, you should
always wait till the `ready` events to fire before interacting with the
player object. However, the player will internally queue messages until
ready is called. :

```js
const player = new playerjs.Player('iframe');

player.on(playerjs.Events.PLAY, () => console.log('play'));

player.on('ready', () => player.setCurrentTime(20));
```

Timing
------

The timing between when the iframe is added and when the ready event is
fired is important. Sadly we cannot fire the ready event till the iframe
is loaded, but there is no concrete way of telling when postmessage is
available to us.

The best way is to do one of the following.

### Create the iframe via JavaScript

```js
const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
iframe.src = 'https://example.com/iframe';
document.body.appendChild(iframe);

const player = new playerjs.Player(iframe);
```

In this case, Player.js will listen to the onload event of the iframe
and only try to communicate when ready.

### Wait for the document to be ready.

```html
<iframe src="//example.com/iframe"></iframe>

<script>
  $(document).on('ready', () => {
    $('iframes').each(() => {
      const player = new playerjs.Player(this);
      player.on('ready', () => player.play());
    });
  });
</script>
```

At this point we can reasonably assume that the iframe's been loaded and
the ready. Player.js will take care of listening for ready events that
were fired before the player is set up.

Methods
-------

`play`: void
Play the media:

```js
player.play();
```

`pause`: void
Pause the media:

```js
player.pause();
```

`getPaused`: boolean
Determine if the media is paused:

```js
player.getPaused(function(value){
  console.log('paused:', value);
});
```

`mute`: void
Mute the media:

```js
player.mute();
```

`unmute`: void
Unmute the media:

```js
player.unmute();
```

`getMuted`: boolean
Determine if the media is muted:

```js
player.getMuted(value => console.log('muted:', value));
```

`setVolume`: void
Set the volume. Value needs to be between 0-100:

```
player.setVolume(50);
```

`getVolume`: number
Get the volume. Value will be between 0-100:

```js
player.getVolume(value => console.log('getVolume:', value));
```

`getDuration`: number
Get the duration of the media is seconds:

```js
player.getDuration(value => console.log('getDuration:', value));
```

`setCurrentTime`: number
Perform a seek to a particular time in seconds:

```js
player.setCurrentTime(50);
```

`getCurrentTime`: number
Get the current time in seconds of the video:

```js
player.getCurrentTime(value => console.log('getCurrentTime:', value));
```

`off`: void
Remove an event listener. If the listener is specified it should remove
only that listener, otherwise remove all listeners:

```js
player.off('play');

player.off('play', playCallback);
```

`on`: void
Add an event listener:

```js
player.on('play', () => console.log('play'));
```

`supports`: \['method', 'event'\], methodOrEventName
Determines if the player supports a given event or method.

```js
player.supports('method', 'getDuration');
player.supports('event', 'ended');
```

Events
------

Events that can be listened to.

`ready`
fired when the media is ready to receive commands. This is fired
regardless of listening to the event. Note: As outlined in the PlayerJs
Spec, you may run into inconsistencies if you have multiple players on
the page with the same `src`. To get around this, simply append a UUID
or a timestamp to the iframe's src to guarantee that all players on the
page have a unique `src`.

`progress`
fires when the media is loading additional media for playback:

```js
{
  percent: 0.8,
}
```

`timeupdate`
fires during playback:

```js
data: {
  seconds: 10,
  duration: 40
}
```

`play`
fires when the video starts to play.

`pause`
fires when the video is paused.

`ended`
fires when the video is finished.

`seeked`
fires when the video has been seeked by the user.

`error`
fires when an error occurs.

Receiver
--------

If you are looking to implement the Player.js spec, we include a
Receiver that will allow you to easily listen to events and takes care
of the house keeping.

```js
const receiver = new playerjs.Receiver();

receiver.on('play', () => {
  video.play();
  receiver.emit('play');
});

receiver.on('pause', () => {
  video.pause();
  receiver.emit('pause');
});

receiver.on('getDuration', callback => callback(video.duration));

receiver.on('getVolume', callback => callback(video.volume*100));

receiver.on('setVolume', value => video.volume = (value/100));

receiver.on('mute', () => video.mute = true)

receiver.on('unmute', () => video.mute = false);

receiver.on('getMuted', callback => callback(video.mute));

receiver.on('getLoop', callback => callback(video.loop));

receiver.on('setLoop', value => video.loop = value);

video.addEventListener('ended', () => receiver.emit('ended'));

video.addEventListener('timeupdate', () => {
  receiver.emit('timeupdate', {
    seconds: video.currentTime,
    duration: video.duration
  });
});

receiver.ready();
```

Methods
-------

`on`
Requests an event from the video. The above player methods should be
implemented. If the event expects a return value a callback will be
passed into the function call:

```js
receiver.on('getDuration', callback => callback(video.duration));
```

Otherwise you can safely ignore any inputs:

```js
receiver.on('play', callback => video.play());
```

`emit`
Sends events to the parent as long as someone is listing. The above
player events should be implemented. If a value is expected, it should
be passed in as the second argument:

    receiver.emit('timeupdate', { seconds:20, duration: 40 });

`ready`
Once everything is in place and you are ready to start responding to
events, call this method. It performs some house keeping, along with
emitting `ready`:

```js
receiver.ready();
```
Adapters
--------

In order to make it super easy to add Player.js to any embed, we have
written adapters for common video libraries. We currently have adapters
for [Video.js](http://www.videojs.com/),
[JWPlayer](https://www.jwplayer.com/) and [HTML5
Video](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/video.html). An Adapter
wraps the Receiver and wires up all the events so your iframe is
Player.js compatible.

### VideoJSAdapter

An adapter for [Video.js](http://www.videojs.com/). :

```js
videojs("video", {}, () => {
  const adapter = new playerjs.VideoJSAdapter(this);
  // ... Do other things to initialize your video.

  // Start accepting events
  adapter.ready();
});
```
### HTML5Adapter

An adapter for [HTML5
Video](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/video.html). :

```js
const video = document.getElementById('video');
video.load();

const adapter = playerjs.HTML5Adapter(video);

// Start accepting events
adapter.ready();
```

### JWPlayerAdapter
An adapter for [JWPlayer](http://www.jwplayer.com).

```js
jwplayer("video").setup({
  file: "/lib/videos/demo.mp4",
  height: '100%',
  width: '100%'
});

const adapter = new playerjs.JWPlayerAdapter(jwplayer());

jwplayer().onReady(() => adapter.ready());
```

### BetaJSAdapter
An adapter for [BetaJS Video Player](http://betajs.com) and [Ziggeo](https://ziggeo.com).

```html
    <ba-videoplayer ba-video="demo.mp4" id="video-player">
    </ba-videoplayer>
```

```js
const video = document.getElementById('video-player').dynamicshandler;

const adapter = playerjs.BetaJSAdapter(video);

// Start accepting events
adapter.ready();
```
